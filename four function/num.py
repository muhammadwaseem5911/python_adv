# Your task is to write a program which:

# asks the user for two separate texts;
# checks whether, the entered texts are anagrams and prints the result.b

# For example:

# if the second string is given as "vcxzxduybfdsobywuefgas", the answer is yes;
# if the second string is "vcxzxdcybfdstbywuefsas", the answer is no (as the letters "d", "o", or "g" don't appear in this order)
